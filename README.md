# 3] PIZZA-ANALYSIS-DASHBOARD-POWER-BI -

This project involved analyzing a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place using Power BI. The data included details on orders, pizzas (type, size, quantity, price, ingredients), and timestamps.

The analysis aimed to:

Understand customer behavior: Determine the number of customers per day, identify peak hours, and measure average order size. Identify bestsellers and sales trends: Analyze pizza order frequency and total revenue to discover the most popular pizzas and track seasonality in sales. Optimize the menu and promotions: Leverage data insights to identify underperforming pizzas and suggest potential menu changes or promotions based on customer preferences. The project utilized DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) within Power BI to create various calculations, including:

Distinct order count: Count the number of unique orders each day. Total sales: Calculate the overall revenue generated throughout the year. Average pizzas per order: Divide the total quantity of pizzas by the total number of orders. Peak hours: Categorize orders into time slots based on timestamps to identify peak hours for sales. This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis using Power BI, DAX calculations, and business intelligence concepts. It showcases the ability to extract valuable insights from data to inform decision-making and improve business operations.
